# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The key objective of any credit card fraud detection system is to identify suspicious events and report them to an analyst while letting normal transactions be automatically processed.

When we make any transaction while purchasing any product online — a good amount of people prefer credit cards. The credit limit in credit cards sometimes helps us me making purchases even if we don’t have the amount at that time. but, on the other hand, these features are misused by cyber attackers.

Here, comes the need for a system that can track the pattern of all the transactions and if any pattern is abnormal then the transaction should be aborted.
